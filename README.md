# makePalindrome-
Sometimes a number is the same when you read it from front to back and from back to front. Two easy examples are 123321 and 891232198.
Write a Method Called makePalindrome() that will return a linked list with a palindrome of the calling list. Example [1,2,3] must return 
[1,2,3,3,2,1] and [8,9,1,4] must return [8,9,1,4,4,1,9,8].

The method does not produce correct output
